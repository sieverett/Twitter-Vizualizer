      <h1>Project Background</h1>
      <p style="font-size:160%;">
        This project was designed to provide a demo of visualizations that could be used to quickly see the engagement levels on a change.org petition. The project was completed for the class W209, Data Visualization, from the Master in Information and Data Science (MIDS) program at University of California at Berkeley (UC Berkeley).  This project specifically made visualizations that enable analytics of social media campaigns in India, through working directly with Change.org program staff on their Gates Foundation funded Women & Girls project in India.

      Change.org seeks to change the narrative of women & girls issues in India from victimhood to being powerful initiators of change.  At the same time, Change.org seeks to build their our own internal capacity to collect social media data more systematically so they can document one of the ways their work impacts social narratives. Our visualization will encode Twitter data to provide the activists the insight they need to make decisions in their campaign.  Based on data from keyword filtering, the visualization will show public awareness of campaign issues such as women's safety, access to health care, discrimination in the workplace, and disabled access.
