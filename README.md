### Users:

This dashboard was developed for Change.org as a final project for UC Berkeley's MIDS Program W209 summer course 2018. Through an interactive visualization dashboard, the project sought to enable petition campaigns to:

1. Track campaign progress 
2. Sharpen strategy and tactics to reach broader audiences
3. Provide the activists the insight they need to make decisions in their communication strategies on Twitter. 

### Specific tasks to be completed with the dashboard:

Task #1: Determine current/historic number of signatures on a petition against the specific campaign goal.
Task #2: Find tweets that relate to the campaign topic in terms of subject, time period and location.
Task #3: Determine if the level of engagement on a campaign topic over a given period of time (measured by # of tweets x followers) is higher or lower compared to another period of time.
Task #4: Find key influencers (on Twitter) who are raising awareness about the campaign topic.
Task #5: Describe any key influencer. e.g. name of user,  number of followers/followers in target audience, number of tweets to target audience (e.g. policy makers, decision makers, celebrities).

### Data:

The dashbord uses Twitter data which was obtained using python tweepy and free tier subscription for the Twitter API. Example data and jupyter notebook can be obtained from the DATA directory.
